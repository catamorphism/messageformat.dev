title: Using MF2 with C++
sidebar_title: C++
---

A Technical Preview implementation of MF2 is available in ICU,
the International Components for Unicode library.
Beginning with version 75.0, ICU includes MF2
implementations in C++ and [Java](/docs/integration/java).

For documentation on the C++ implementation, see
[the ICU API guide](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/classicu_1_1message2_1_1MessageFormatter.html).
The [ICU User Guide](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/) contains
general information on using ICU, but has not yet been updated to include
MF2 documentation.
