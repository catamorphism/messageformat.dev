A Technical Preview implementation of MF2 is available in ICU,
the International Components for Unicode library.
Beginning with version 75.0, ICU includes MF2
implementations in Java and [C++](/docs/integration/cpp).

For documentation on the Java implementation, see
[the ICU API guide](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/message2/package-summary.html).
The [ICU User Guide](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/) contains
general information on using ICU, but has not yet been updated to include
MF2 documentation.
